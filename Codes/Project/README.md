# Night_Security_Light
A night security light with Arduino can enhance security and visibility during nighttime by automatically turning on a light when it detects movement in low light conditions. This can serve as a restrictive to potential trespassers and provide lighting for improved surveillance.

## How to run


## Software
To run code on an Arduino Uno, you'll need to follow these general steps:

### Install the Arduino IDE:

If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the official Arduino website at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.

### Connect the Arduino Uno:
Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the board is properly powered.

### Open the Arduino IDE:
Launch the Arduino IDE that you installed earlier.

### Select the Arduino Uno Board:
In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" > "Board" and select "Arduino Uno" as your target board.

### Select the Correct Port:
Still in the "Tools" menu, go to "Port" and select the COM port that corresponds to your Arduino Uno. The exact name of the port may vary depending on your operating system.


### Write or Open Your Code:
You can either write your own Arduino code or open an existing Arduino sketch. The Arduino IDE comes with a variety of example sketches that you can use as a starting point.


### Upload Your Code:
Click the right-facing arrow button (â®•) or go to "Sketch" > "Upload" to compile and upload your code to the Arduino Uno. The code will be transferred to the board, and the onboard LED should blink during the process. Once the upload is complete, you should see "Done uploading" in the status bar at the bottom of the IDE.

### Verify Operation:
If your code is designed to interact with hardware components (e.g., sensors, motors, LEDs), make sure those components are properly connected to the Arduino Uno and that your code is configured to use the correct pins and settings.

###  Monitor Serial Output (if applicable):
If your code includes Serial print statements, you can open the Serial Monitor by clicking the magnifying glass button in the top-right corner of the Arduino IDE. This allows you to view the output of your Arduino program for debugging purposes.


### Power Supply (if needed):
Depending on your project, you may need an external power supply for the Arduino Uno if it requires more power than can be provided via USB.
